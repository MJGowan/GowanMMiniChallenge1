Mini Challenge 1 - Redo
In this challenge we had to enter our name into the terminal, and have the computer provide a response, a "hello".

Peer Reviewed by Amardeep Mann: The if/else statemnet was a great choice and good call on using ToLower() to check for mixed-case inputs. The play again feature works great via the while loop. I thought it was pretty funny that there is a specific right answer for this game, very nice touch. Maybe in a future revision you can interpolate the user's name in the "Not who I was expecting" text somehow. Great work!

Response by Madeline Gowan: Thank you! I added the users name into the second response as you suggested. I never considered that, so I appreciate the feedback!!
